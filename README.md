# Gtronix's Ansible Repository

Welcome to my chaotic corner of the internet! This is my personal stash of Ansible playbooks and roles, lovingly crafted to automate my environment and maybe cause a few delightful surprises along the way.

## Features

- **Automated Setup**: A streamlined process for configuring my servers, ensuring everything is just a command away.
- **Custom Playbooks**: A collection of scripts that handle repetitive tasks so I can focus on the fun stuff, like contemplating the meaning of life (or just binge-watching shows).
- **Roles Galore**: Predefined roles for different services, making it easier for me to deploy and manage projects without losing my sanity.
